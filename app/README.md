# zzhack
My personal blog site which based on by Rust & Yew, the motivation for build this site is just I want a place where I can thinking and write it down.

## UI Design
Not surprisingly, I designed three versions of the design, actually as you can see the current version is 3.0.0 version.

It's worth to mention that, oh I love dark mode, so the `zzhack` also support dark mode of course.
